shows they watched were.

Features include:
-loading local image files, 
-loading the thumbnail of an anime in one's list,
-loading system or custom font
-placing custom text, that consisting of the anime name, episodes seen, and completetion status
-rotatable text and images
-and a large list of Filters to alter the look of text and images such as warp,skew,sharpen,opacitize,colorize, and many more


Runnable out of the box with example script, images, and font included

./images is used to hold image files to be placed on your signature
./fonts supports .tff files to affect the look on your text
./cache is required to be intact to load the animelist and cache anime thumbnails to be reused
.sig.ini is the script that controls what is created overall, use your imagination!
